## Overview
This project involves containerizing a web application using Docker and Docker Compose. The application consists of an Angular frontend and a Spring Boot backend. The main objective is to create a multi-container Docker application to simplify deployment and management.

## Features
- **Angular Frontend:** Dynamic and responsive web interface.
- **Spring Boot Backend:** Robust backend service handling business logic and data processing.
- **Docker Containerization:** Isolated and consistent environments for frontend and backend.
- **Docker Compose:** Manages multi-container setup, defining services, networks, and volumes.

## File Structure
- `AngularFrontend/`: Angular application code.
- `SpringBootBackend/`: Spring Boot application code.
- `DB.sql`: SQL file for database schema or sample data.
- `Dockerfile`: Configuration for building Docker images.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the multi-container Docker application setup.
